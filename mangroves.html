<h1>What are Mangroves</h1>
<h2>Mangroves are tropical plants that are adapted to loose, wet 
saltwater and being periodically submerged by tides. Four major factors appear to limit the<br> 
of mangroves: climate, salt water, tidal fluctuation and soil type. There are more that 50 species   
mangroves found throughout the world.</h2><br>

<h1>Species of Mangroves</h1>
<h2>There are about 80 different species of mangrove trees. All kinds of species are usually found at 
different places. Some of them are:<br>

1- Red mangrove<br>

2- Black mangrove<br>

3- White mangrove<br>

4- Loop-root mangrove<br>

5- Avicennia marina<br>

6- Rhizophora apiculata<br>

7- Laguncularia racemosa<br>

8- Bruguiera gymnorhiza<br>

9- Lumnitzera racemosa<br>

10- Ceriops tagal<br>

11- button wood <br><br>

The Black Mangroves is the most common among all the species.
</h2><br><br>

<h1>Where are mangroves found globally?</h1>
<h2>Mangroves are found all over the tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Indonesia is the country with the most mangroves. Brazil, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, and Australia also have mangrove forests.</h2><br>
<br><br><br>

<h1>What is unique about mangroves?</h1>
<h2>Mangroves are the only species of trees in the world that can tolerate saltwater. They are halophytes, meaning they can tolerate salt and are able to live in areas where oceans and seas meet the land.<br>
  Mangroves are hotspots of biodiversity. They form the foundation of highly productive and biologically rich ecosystems, providing a home, nursery and feeding ground for a wide range of species of fish, crustacea, birds, insects and reptiles. Some migratory shorebirds rely on mangroves as roost sites, and the vulnerable Water Mouse depends on mangrove habitats.</h2><br>
<br><br><br>

<h1>Habitat and adaptations of Mangroves</h1>
<h2>Mangrove forests only grow at tropical and subtropical latitudes near the equator because they 
cannot survive the freezing temperatures. Many mangrove<br> forests can be recognized by their 
tangle of prop roots that make the trees appear to be standing on stilts above the water</h2><br>

<h1>How are Mangroves helpful to the enviroment and What impact does mangroves have on the economy?</h1>
<h2>1- Mangrove forests stabilize the coastline by reducing erosion caused
 by storm surges, currents, waves and tides.<br><br>
2- Mangroves protect water quality by removing nutrients and pollutants from
stormwater runoff before they reach seagrass habitats and coral reefs.<br><br>
3- Mangrove peat absorbs water during heavy rains and storm surge, reducing
the chances of coastal flooding.<br><br>
4- Mangroves provide nursery habitat for many commercial fish and shellfish,
and thus contribute to the local abundance of seafood.<br><br>
5-Mangrove systems provide shelter to a range of wildlife species including
birds, deer and honey bees.<br><br>
6- Mangroves serve as nesting areas for coastal birds such as little blue herons,
great egrets and brown pelicans. Many birds depend on mangroves for<br> part
of their seasonal migrations. Even dead mangroves play an important role,
providing roosting areas for bird species.</h2><br>

<h1>Facts about Mangroves you need to Know!</h1>
<h2>
Fact 1:Mangroves can be a bit salty<br>
Unlike most trees, mangroves can grow directly in salty or brackish water. Their strategies<br> for dealing with otherwise toxic levels of salinity vary — some species secrete 
salt after it is <br>absorbed, while others filter out salt from the surrounding seawater.<br><br>

Fact 2:Mangroves come in a variety of sizes<br>
Though estimates vary, there are at least 50 — and maybe as many as 80 — mangrove species, ranging in <br>height from small shrubs to trees that stand 40 meters above the water, but all species 
thrive in low-oxygen,<br> high-saline coastal environments.<br><br>

Fact 3:Fish flock to mangroves<br>
Mangroves, specifically the underwater habitat their roots provide, offer critical nursing environments for<br> juveniles of many marine species, from tiny gobies to massive crocodiles. <br><br> 

Fact 4:Mangroves live on the edge<br>
Mangrove forests can be found on the saltwater coasts of more than 100 tropical and subtropical countries<br>, totaling more than 140,000 square kilometers (54,000 square miles) 
— roughly the size of Greece or Arkansas.<br><br>

Fact 5:Indonesia tops the worldwide list<br>
The largest amount of mangrove coverage can be found in Indonesia, where mangrove trees cover  about<br> 12,000 square miles— that's more than
twice the size of Jamaica or roughly the size of Maryland.<br><br>

Fact 6:Florida mangroves prefer the southern coast<br>
The United States has roughly 2,000 square kilometers (about 800 square miles) of mangroves — an area<br> about four-fifths the size of Luxembourg — located almost entirely in 
southern Florida.<br><br>
 
Fact 7:Mangroves have (carbon) hoarding issues<br>
In a single square mile, blue carbon ecosystems like mangroves hold as much carbon as the annual emissions<br> of 90,000 carsJump to references8, making them a critical solution in the fight 
against climate change.<br><br> 

Fact 8:Mangroves can help keep people safe<br>
Mangrove forests — specifically, their thick, impenetrable roots — are vital to shoreline communities as<br> natural buffers against storm surgesJump to references9, an increasing threat in a 
changing global <br>climate with rising sea levels.<br><br>

Fact 9:There's trouble in Myanmar<br>
Mangroves are under threat nearly everywhere, but the problem is particularly acute in Myanmar, where<br> one study estimatedJump to references10 the mangrove loss rate is more than five times the\
global average.<br><br>
</h2><br>

<h1>What Will happen if Mangroves get extinct?</h1>
<h2>
   -A world without mangroves would likely mean a world with fewer fishes, more coastal damage, and<br> unknown ecosystem and public health 
   consequences related to changes in pollutant, sediment and carbon cycles.<br>
   -Mangroves protect coastlines from floods but without Mangroves the number of floods could incrase!<br>
   -Mangroves are also habitats to a great ammout of sea creatures; mostly sea animals come to mangrove<br> to breed and to lay there eggs; What will happen to them?<br>
